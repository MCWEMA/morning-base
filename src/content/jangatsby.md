Just in time for Christmas. Our friends at Gatsby were very kind with this nice present for the V4 Early Adaptors. A BIG Thank you.

We are very exited about all new additions and improvements. Keep the good work going.

using html width wrapper 100%

<img src="img/Jan-2022/DSC_0027.JPG" alt="Kitten"

width 125%

<img src="img/Jan-2022/DSC_0028.JPG" alt="Kitten"
    title="A cute kitten" width=125%  />

height 20%. It looks like height has no effect here.
<img src="img/Jan-2022/DSC_0027.JPG" alt="Kitten"
    title="A cute kitten"  height="20%" />
